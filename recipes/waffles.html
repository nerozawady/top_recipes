    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>From Wikipedia:<br>
        <blockquote>A waffle is a dish made from leavened batter or dough that is cooked between two plates that are patterned to give a characteristic size, shape, and surface impression. There are many variations based on the type of waffle iron and recipe used. Waffles are eaten throughout the world, particularly in Belgium, which has over a dozen regional varieties.[1] Waffles may be made fresh or simply heated after having been commercially cooked and frozen.</blockquote>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs: This waffle recipe starts with two whole eggs, whisked until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour adds gluten, which gives the waffles structure. You can also use whole wheat flour.</li>
        <li>Milk: Whole milk lends richness and moisture. Plus, it helps create the ideal batter consistency.</li>
        <li>Oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, ensures the waffles are nice and moist.</li>
        <li>Sugar: A tablespoon of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
        <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it contributes to the waffles' light and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors. Don't skip this step!</li>
        <li>Vanilla: A dash of vanilla adds complexity and enhances the overfall flavor.</li>
        <li>Cooking spray: You'll need to spray the iron with nonstick cooking spray before you start making the waffles.</li>
    </ul>
